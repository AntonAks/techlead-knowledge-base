# JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## What are JSON Web Tokens?

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications and APIs.

JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

## JWT Structure

A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots (`.`):

```
header.payload.signature
```

### **Complete JWT Example**
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

## JWT Components

### **1. Header**
Contains metadata about the token type and signing algorithm.

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

**Common Header Claims**:
- `alg`: Algorithm used to sign the token (HS256, RS256, etc.)
- `typ`: Token type (usually "JWT")
- `kid`: Key ID (when using multiple keys)

### **2. Payload**
Contains the claims (statements about an entity and additional data).

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516242622,
  "iss": "https://api.example.com",
  "aud": "https://app.example.com"
}
```

### **3. Signature**
Verifies that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and ensures the message wasn't changed along the way.

```javascript
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

## JWT Claims

### **Registered Claims** (Standard)
- `iss` (issuer): Who issued the token
- `sub` (subject): Who the token is about (usually user ID)
- `aud` (audience): Who the token is intended for
- `exp` (expiration time): When the token expires (Unix timestamp)
- `nbf` (not before): When the token becomes valid
- `iat` (issued at): When the token was issued
- `jti` (JWT ID): Unique identifier for the token

### **Public Claims**
Defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or defined as a URI to avoid collisions.

### **Private Claims**
Custom claims agreed upon by parties using the token.

```json
{
  "sub": "user123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "permissions": ["read", "write", "delete"],
  "team": "engineering",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516242622,
  "iss": "https://auth.example.com",
  "aud": ["https://api.example.com", "https://app.example.com"]
}
```

## How JWT Works

### **Authentication Flow**
```
1. User logs in with credentials
   ┌─────────┐   Login    ┌─────────────┐
   │ Client  │ ────────→ │   Server    │
   └─────────┘           └─────────────┘

2. Server validates credentials and returns JWT
   ┌─────────┐    JWT     ┌─────────────┐
   │ Client  │ ←──────── │   Server    │
   └─────────┘           └─────────────┘

3. Client includes JWT in subsequent requests
   ┌─────────┐  Request   ┌─────────────┐
   │ Client  │ ────────→ │   Server    │
   └─────────┘  + JWT     └─────────────┘

4. Server verifies JWT and processes request
   ┌─────────┐  Response  ┌─────────────┐
   │ Client  │ ←──────── │   Server    │
   └─────────┘           └─────────────┘
```

### **Step-by-Step Process**

#### **1. User Authentication**
```http
POST /api/auth/login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
```

#### **2. Server Response with JWT**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": "user123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

#### **3. Using JWT in Requests**
```http
GET /api/profile HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Accept: application/json
```

# JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## What are JSON Web Tokens?

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They provide a standardized way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object and are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications and APIs.

JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a self-contained method for securely transmitting information. The token itself contains all the information needed to verify its authenticity without requiring additional database lookups.

## JWT Structure and Components

A JWT consists of three Base64URL-encoded parts separated by dots: **header.payload.signature**

### **Header**
Contains metadata about the token including the type of token and the cryptographic algorithm used to secure it. The header typically specifies the algorithm (such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA) and declares that this is a JWT.

### **Payload**
Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data. Claims are categorized into three types: registered, public, and private claims.

### **Signature**
Used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. The signature is created by encoding the header and payload using Base64url encoding, then signing the result with the specified algorithm and secret.

## JWT Claims

### **Registered Claims**
These are predefined claims that are not mandatory but recommended for interoperability:

- **iss (issuer)**: Identifies who issued the token
- **sub (subject)**: Identifies the subject of the token (usually the user ID)
- **aud (audience)**: Identifies the recipients for whom the JWT is intended
- **exp (expiration time)**: Defines when the token expires (Unix timestamp)
- **nbf (not before)**: Defines when the token becomes valid
- **iat (issued at)**: Identifies when the token was issued
- **jti (JWT ID)**: Provides a unique identifier for the token

### **Public Claims**
These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. To avoid collisions, they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision-resistant namespace.

### **Private Claims**
These are custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them. They are neither registered nor public claims.

## How JWT Authentication Works

### **Authentication Flow**
The typical JWT authentication process involves several steps:

1. **User Login**: User provides credentials (username/password)
2. **Credential Verification**: Server validates the provided credentials
3. **Token Generation**: Server creates a JWT containing user information and claims
4. **Token Response**: Server returns the JWT to the client
5. **Token Storage**: Client stores the token (preferably securely)
6. **Authenticated Requests**: Client includes JWT in subsequent API requests
7. **Token Verification**: Server validates the JWT on each request
8. **Request Processing**: Server processes the request if token is valid

### **Token Lifecycle Management**
JWTs have a defined lifecycle that includes creation, validation, refresh, and expiration. Proper lifecycle management is crucial for security and user experience.

## JWT vs Other Authentication Methods

### **JWT vs Session Cookies**

**Storage and State Management**
- JWT: Client-side storage, stateless server
- Sessions: Server-side storage, stateful server

**Scalability Characteristics**
- JWT: Excellent horizontal scaling, no shared storage needed
- Sessions: Requires shared session storage for scaling

**Security Properties**
- JWT: Cannot be immediately revoked, larger attack surface
- Sessions: Can be instantly invalidated, smaller token size

**Performance Considerations**
- JWT: No database lookup required for validation
- Sessions: Requires session store lookup on each request

**Cross-Domain Usage**
- JWT: Easy to use across different domains and services
- Sessions: Requires additional CORS configuration

### **When to Use JWT**
- **Microservices Architecture**: Stateless authentication across services
- **Single Page Applications**: Client-side token management
- **Mobile Applications**: Native token handling capabilities
- **Distributed Systems**: No need for shared session storage
- **Cross-Domain APIs**: Easy inclusion in HTTP headers

### **When to Use Sessions**
- **Traditional Web Applications**: Server-rendered applications
- **High Security Requirements**: Need for immediate token revocation
- **Complex Session Data**: Rich server-side session state management
- **Sensitive Applications**: Minimize client-side token exposure

## JWT Security Considerations

### **Common Security Vulnerabilities**

#### **Algorithm Confusion Attacks**
Attackers may attempt to change the algorithm specified in the JWT header to weaken security. Always explicitly specify allowed algorithms during verification.

#### **Weak Signing Secrets**
Using predictable or short secrets makes JWTs vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Always use cryptographically strong, randomly generated secrets of sufficient length.

#### **Token Exposure**
Storing JWTs in URLs, local storage, or session storage can expose them to various attacks. Consider the security implications of different storage methods.

#### **Missing Signature Verification**
Simply decoding a JWT without verifying its signature provides no security. Always verify the signature before trusting token contents.

#### **Insufficient Token Validation**
Failing to validate claims like expiration time, issuer, or audience can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### **Security Best Practices**

#### **Token Storage Security**
- Avoid storing JWTs in localStorage or sessionStorage for sensitive applications
- Consider httpOnly cookies for web applications
- Use in-memory storage for single-page applications when possible
- Implement secure token transmission methods

#### **Secret Management**
- Use cryptographically strong random secrets (minimum 256 bits)
- Store secrets securely using environment variables or secret management systems
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different secrets for different token types

#### **Token Validation**
- Always verify token signatures
- Validate all relevant claims (exp, iss, aud)
- Implement proper error handling for invalid tokens
- Check token blacklists when immediate revocation is needed

#### **Token Lifecycle**
- Use short expiration times for access tokens
- Implement refresh token patterns for longer sessions
- Provide secure logout mechanisms
- Monitor for suspicious token usage patterns

## Token Refresh Patterns

### **Access and Refresh Token Strategy**
This pattern uses short-lived access tokens paired with longer-lived refresh tokens. Access tokens are used for API requests, while refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens when they expire.

#### **Benefits**
- Limits exposure window if access token is compromised
- Maintains user sessions without frequent re-authentication
- Provides mechanism for token revocation
- Balances security and user experience

#### **Implementation Considerations**
- Store refresh tokens securely (preferably httpOnly cookies)
- Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Provide mechanism to revoke refresh tokens
- Handle refresh failures gracefully

### **Sliding Window Tokens**
Tokens that automatically extend their expiration time when used within a certain timeframe. This approach maintains active sessions while still providing security through expiration.

## JWT in Different Architectures

### **Microservices Authentication**
In microservices architectures, JWTs enable stateless authentication across service boundaries. Services can validate tokens independently without communicating with a central authentication server.

#### **Service-to-Service Communication**
- API gateways can validate tokens and forward user context
- Services receive pre-validated user information
- No need for shared authentication databases
- Enables independent service scaling

#### **Token Propagation**
- Tokens can be forwarded between services
- Service mesh can handle token validation
- Distributed tracing can correlate requests using token information

### **Single Sign-On (SSO) Implementation**
JWTs can facilitate SSO across multiple applications and domains by providing a standard token format that different services can validate.

#### **Identity Provider Integration**
- Central identity provider issues JWTs
- Multiple applications accept the same tokens
- Cross-domain authentication without credential sharing
- Standardized user information format

### **Mobile and Native Applications**
JWTs are well-suited for mobile applications due to their self-contained nature and platform independence.

#### **Native Application Considerations**
- No cookie handling complexity
- Easy to include in HTTP headers
- Can work offline for certain operations
- Cross-platform compatibility

## JWT Performance Optimization

### **Token Size Management**
JWTs can become large when they contain extensive user information or permissions. Optimize token size by:

- Including only essential claims
- Using short claim names
- Avoiding large arrays or objects
- Implementing claim references instead of full data

### **Caching Strategies**
While JWTs are stateless, certain validation operations can benefit from caching:

- Cache public keys for signature verification
- Cache token validation results for short periods
- Use distributed caches for blacklist checks
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation

### **Signature Algorithm Selection**
Different algorithms have different performance characteristics:

- HMAC algorithms are faster but require shared secrets
- RSA algorithms enable asymmetric verification but are slower
- ECDSA provides good security with better performance than RSA
- Consider algorithm performance for high-throughput applications

## Error Handling and Debugging

### **Common JWT Errors**
Understanding and properly handling JWT errors improves user experience and security:

#### **Token Expiration**
Handle expired tokens gracefully with appropriate error messages and automatic refresh attempts when possible.

#### **Invalid Signatures**
Distinguish between malformed tokens and potentially malicious tokens with invalid signatures.

#### **Missing or Malformed Tokens**
Provide clear error messages for authentication requirements and proper token formatting.

#### **Insufficient Permissions**
Handle authorization failures with informative error messages that don't expose sensitive information.

### **Debugging Strategies**
Effective JWT debugging requires understanding token structure and validation process:

- Decode tokens safely for inspection (without verification for debugging only)
- Log authentication events with appropriate detail levels
- Implement health checks for JWT services
- Monitor token validation metrics

## JWT in Production Environments

### **Configuration Management**
Production JWT implementations require careful configuration:

- Use environment-specific secrets and configurations
- Implement proper secret rotation procedures
- Configure appropriate token expiration times
- Set up monitoring and alerting for authentication events

### **Monitoring and Observability**
Track JWT usage and security metrics:

- Monitor token validation success/failure rates
- Track token expiration patterns
- Alert on suspicious authentication patterns
- Measure authentication performance metrics

### **Scalability Considerations**
Design JWT implementations for scale:

- Plan for high-throughput token validation
- Implement efficient signature verification
- Consider token validation caching strategies
- Design for horizontal scaling

### **Disaster Recovery**
Prepare for JWT-related failures:

- Plan for secret compromise scenarios
- Implement token revocation mechanisms
- Design fallback authentication methods
- Create incident response procedures

## Advanced JWT Patterns

### **Nested JWTs**
For complex scenarios, JWTs can be nested or chained to provide additional layers of security or functionality.

### **Encrypted JWTs (JWE)**
When payload confidentiality is required, JWT content can be encrypted using JSON Web Encryption standards.

### **Multi-Audience Tokens**
Tokens can be designed to work across multiple services or applications by including multiple audiences in the claims.

### **Role-Based Access Control**
Implement sophisticated authorization by including role and permission information in JWT claims.
