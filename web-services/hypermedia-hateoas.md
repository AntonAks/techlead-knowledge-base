# Hypermedia & HATEOAS

## What is Hypermedia?

**Hypermedia** is an extension of hypertext that includes multimedia content and interactive elements. In the context of APIs, hypermedia refers to the practice of embedding links and actions within API responses, allowing clients to discover available operations dynamically rather than having them hardcoded.

**HATEOAS** (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of REST architecture where clients interact with applications entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

## Core Concepts

### **Hypermedia Controls**
Links and forms embedded in responses that tell clients what actions are available:
- **Links**: Navigation to related resources
- **Actions**: Available operations on current resource
- **Forms**: Templates for creating or updating resources
- **Relations**: Semantic meaning of links and actions

### **Dynamic Discovery**
Instead of hardcoding API endpoints, clients discover capabilities through responses:
- **Self-Describing**: APIs explain their own capabilities
- **Evolving**: Servers can change available actions without breaking clients
- **Context-Aware**: Available actions depend on current resource state
- **Loosely Coupled**: Clients don't need prior knowledge of all endpoints

## HATEOAS in Practice

### **Traditional Approach (Without HATEOAS)**
Client needs to know all URLs and operations upfront:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "status": "active"
}
```
Client must hardcode knowledge:
- GET /users/123 to retrieve user
- PUT /users/123 to update user
- DELETE /users/123 to delete user
- POST /users/123/activate to activate user

### **HATEOAS Approach**
Server provides available actions in response:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe", 
  "status": "active",
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/users/123" },
    "edit": { "href": "/users/123", "method": "PUT" },
    "delete": { "href": "/users/123", "method": "DELETE" },
    "deactivate": { "href": "/users/123/deactivate", "method": "POST" },
    "orders": { "href": "/users/123/orders" },
    "profile": { "href": "/users/123/profile" }
  }
}
```

### **State-Dependent Actions**
Available actions change based on resource state:

**Active User:**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "status": "active",
  "_links": {
    "deactivate": { "href": "/users/123/deactivate", "method": "POST" },
    "suspend": { "href": "/users/123/suspend", "method": "POST" }
  }
}
```

**Inactive User:**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "status": "inactive", 
  "_links": {
    "activate": { "href": "/users/123/activate", "method": "POST" },
    "delete": { "href": "/users/123", "method": "DELETE" }
  }
}
```

## Hypermedia Formats

### **HAL (Hypertext Application Language)**
Popular format for hypermedia APIs:
- **_links**: Navigation links to related resources
- **_embedded**: Embedded sub-resources
- **Relations**: Standard and custom link relations
- **Templated URLs**: Support for URL templates with parameters

### **JSON-LD (JSON Linked Data)**
Semantic web approach to hypermedia:
- **@context**: Vocabulary definitions
- **@type**: Resource type information
- **@id**: Unique resource identifier
- **Semantic Relations**: Rich relationship definitions

### **Siren**
Structured format for hypermedia APIs:
- **Entities**: Embedded sub-entities
- **Actions**: Available operations with form definitions
- **Links**: Navigation to related resources
- **Classes**: Resource classification

### **Collection+JSON**
Format focused on collection management:
- **Items**: Collection members
- **Queries**: Available search operations
- **Template**: Form for creating new items
- **Error Handling**: Structured error information

## Real-World Implementation Examples

### **GitHub API**
GitHub extensively uses hypermedia in their REST API:

**Repository Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "hello-world",
  "full_name": "octocat/hello-world",
  "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat/hello-world",
  "clone_url": "https://github.com/octocat/hello-world.git",
  "issues_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/issues{/number}",
  "pulls_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/pulls{/number}",
  "branches_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/branches{/branch}"
}
```

**Benefits for GitHub:**
- **API Evolution**: Add new features without breaking existing clients
- **Self-Documentation**: Responses show available operations
- **Context Sensitivity**: Actions available based on user permissions
- **Discoverability**: Clients can explore API capabilities dynamically

### **PayPal API**
PayPal uses HATEOAS for payment workflows:

**Payment Resource:**
```json
{
  "id": "PAY-123456789",
  "state": "created",
  "links": [
    {
      "href": "https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/payment/PAY-123456789",
      "rel": "self",
      "method": "GET"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&token=TOKEN",
      "rel": "approval_url", 
      "method": "REDIRECT"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/payment/PAY-123456789/execute",
      "rel": "execute",
      "method": "POST"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Workflow Benefits:**
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Payment flow adapts to different scenarios
- **State Management**: Available actions change with payment state
- **Error Recovery**: Alternative actions provided for failed operations
- **Integration Simplicity**: Clients follow links rather than constructing URLs
