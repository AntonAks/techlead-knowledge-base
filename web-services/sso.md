# SSO (Single Sign-On)

## What is SSO?

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is an authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. Users authenticate once and gain access to all authorized systems without needing to log in again for each application.

## Key Benefits

- **User Experience**: One login for multiple applications
- **Security**: Centralized authentication and password policies
- **Administration**: Simplified user management and provisioning
- **Compliance**: Centralized audit trails and access control
- **Productivity**: Reduced password fatigue and login friction

## Core Components

### **Identity Provider (IdP)**
- Authenticates users and issues security tokens
- Stores user identities and credentials
- Examples: Active Directory, Okta, Auth0, Google Identity

### **Service Provider (SP)**
- Applications that rely on IdP for authentication
- Trusts IdP to verify user identity
- Examples: Salesforce, Office 365, internal applications

### **Security Tokens**
- Digital proof of authentication
- Contains user identity and attributes
- Types: SAML assertions, JWT tokens, Kerberos tickets

## SSO Protocols

### **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**
XML-based standard for exchanging authentication data:
- **SAML 2.0**: Current widely-used version
- **Assertions**: Authentication, authorization, attribute statements
- **Bindings**: HTTP POST, HTTP Redirect, SOAP
- **Profiles**: Web Browser SSO, Identity Provider Discovery

### **OAuth 2.0 + OIDC (OpenID Connect)**
Modern web-friendly approach:
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorization framework
- **OpenID Connect**: Authentication layer on OAuth 2.0
- **JSON-based**: Lightweight compared to SAML
- **Mobile-friendly**: Better for native applications

### **Kerberos**
Network authentication protocol:
- **Ticket-based**: Uses encrypted tickets for authentication
- **Windows Integration**: Default in Active Directory environments
- **Enterprise Focus**: Strong in on-premises corporate environments
- **Mutual Authentication**: Both client and server authenticate

## Implementation Patterns

### **SAML Web SSO Flow**
1. **User Access**: User tries to access application (SP)
2. **Redirect**: SP redirects user to IdP login page
3. **Authentication**: User authenticates with IdP
4. **Assertion**: IdP sends SAML assertion to SP
5. **Access Granted**: SP validates assertion and grants access

### **OIDC Authorization Code Flow**
1. **Authorization Request**: Client redirects user to IdP
2. **User Consent**: User authenticates and consents
3. **Authorization Code**: IdP returns authorization code
4. **Token Exchange**: Client exchanges code for tokens
5. **Access**: Client uses tokens to access protected resources

### **Enterprise Federation**
- **Cross-Domain**: SSO across different organizations
- **Trust Relationships**: Federated identity agreements
- **Attribute Mapping**: User attribute translation between systems
- **Policy Enforcement**: Centralized access policies

## Real-World Examples

### **Google Workspace**
- **Gmail, Drive, Calendar**: One login for all Google services
- **Third-Party Apps**: Google SSO for external applications
- **SAML/OIDC**: Supports both protocols for integration
- **Admin Console**: Centralized user and app management

### **Microsoft 365**
- **Office Apps**: Word, Excel, Teams with single authentication
- **Azure AD**: Identity provider for enterprise applications
- **Conditional Access**: Policy-based access control
- **Hybrid Identity**: On-premises and cloud integration

### **Okta**
- **Identity Platform**: Centralized SSO for thousands of apps
- **App Catalog**: Pre-integrated SaaS applications
- **Multi-Factor**: Built-in MFA support
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated user provisioning

### **Enterprise Implementations**
- **Corporate Intranets**: Employee access to internal systems
- **Customer Portals**: Single login for customer-facing applications
- **Partner Extranets**: Federated access for business partners
- **Educational Systems**: Student and faculty access to academic tools

## SSO Architecture Patterns

### **Centralized SSO**
- **Single IdP**: One identity provider for all applications
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: All applications connect to central IdP
- **Uniform Policies**: Consistent security policies across apps
- **Single Point of Failure**: IdP availability critical

### **Federated SSO**
- **Multiple IdPs**: Different identity providers for different domains
- **Trust Networks**: Federated trust relationships
- **Cross-Domain**: Users from one domain access another's resources
- **Distributed**: No single point of failure

### **Hybrid SSO**
- **Cloud + On-Premises**: Mix of cloud and traditional systems
- **Directory Sync**: Synchronize identities between systems
- **Protocol Translation**: Bridge different authentication protocols
- **Gradual Migration**: Phased cloud adoption

## Security Considerations

### **Token Security**
- **Token Expiration**: Short-lived tokens reduce risk
- **Token Validation**: Proper signature and claim validation
- **Secure Storage**: Protect tokens from theft
- **Token Refresh**: Secure token renewal mechanisms

### **Session Management**
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Global Logout**: Single logout from all applications
- **Session Tracking**: Monitor active user sessions
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Control simultaneous logins

### **Multi-Factor Authentication**
- **Second Factor**: SMS, email, authenticator apps
- **Risk-Based**: Adaptive authentication based on context
- **Hardware Tokens**: FIDO/WebAuthn for high security
- **Biometrics**: Fingerprint, face recognition

## Implementation Challenges

### **Technical Complexity**
- **Protocol Differences**: SAML vs OIDC implementation variations
- **Clock Synchronization**: Time-sensitive token validation
- **Certificate Management**: PKI certificate lifecycle
- **Network Dependencies**: Reliable connectivity between systems

### **User Experience**
- **Application Discovery**: How users find available applications
- **Logout Behavior**: Managing logout across multiple applications
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Mobile Experience**: SSO on mobile devices and apps

### **Security Risks**
- **Single Point of Attack**: Compromised IdP affects all applications
- **Token Hijacking**: Stolen tokens provide broad access
- **Privilege Escalation**: Over-privileged user accounts
- **Identity Sprawl**: Unused accounts and excessive permissions

## Best Practices

### **Identity Management**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodic permission audits
- **Automated Provisioning**: Just-in-time access management
