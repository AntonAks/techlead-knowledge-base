# Richardson Maturity Model

## Overview

The **Richardson Maturity Model** is a framework for evaluating the maturity level of REST APIs, developed by Leonard Richardson. It provides a way to assess how well an API follows REST principles through four progressive levels (0-3), with each level building upon the previous one.

The model helps organizations understand where their APIs currently stand and provides a roadmap for improving REST compliance and API design quality.

## The Four Levels

### **Level 0: The Swamp of POX (Plain Old XML)**
The starting point where HTTP is used purely as a transport mechanism.

**Characteristics:**
- **Single Endpoint**: All operations use one URL
- **Single HTTP Method**: Usually only POST
- **RPC-Style**: Remote procedure call approach
- **Action-Based**: Operations defined by message content, not HTTP methods

**Example API Structure:**
```
POST /api/service
Content-Type: application/xml

<request>
  <operation>getUserById</operation>
  <userId>123</userId>
</request>
```

**Common Patterns:**
- **SOAP Web Services**: Traditional XML-based web services
- **JSON-RPC**: JSON-based remote procedure calls
- **Legacy APIs**: Many older enterprise APIs
- **Tunneling**: All operations through HTTP POST

### **Level 1: Resources**
Introduction of multiple resources but still using HTTP incorrectly.

**Characteristics:**
- **Multiple URLs**: Different endpoints for different resources
- **Resource Identification**: Each resource has its own URI
- **Still RPC-Style**: Operations still action-based
- **Limited HTTP Methods**: Typically only GET and POST

**Example API Structure:**
```
POST /api/users/getUser
POST /api/users/createUser  
POST /api/users/updateUser
POST /api/users/deleteUser
```

**Improvements Over Level 0:**
- **Resource Organization**: Logical grouping of related operations
- **URL Structure**: Meaningful URL patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different endpoints for different resources
- **Scalability**: Easier to manage and maintain

### **Level 2: HTTP Verbs**
Proper use of HTTP methods to indicate operation intent.

**Characteristics:**
- **Semantic HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE used correctly
- **Status Codes**: Appropriate HTTP status codes in responses
- **Idempotency**: Proper understanding of method properties
- **Safety**: GET requests don't modify state

**Example API Structure:**
```
GET    /api/users/123      # Retrieve user
POST   /api/users          # Create user
PUT    /api/users/123      # Update user
DELETE /api/users/123      # Delete user
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Method Semantics**: Each HTTP method has clear meaning
- **Cacheability**: GET requests can be cached
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500, etc.)
- **Web Standards**: Leverages HTTP protocol features

### **Level 3: Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)**
Full REST implementation with hypermedia as the engine of application state.

**Characteristics:**
- **Hypermedia Links**: Responses include links to related resources
- **State Transitions**: Available actions embedded in responses
- **Self-Describing**: APIs provide information about capabilities
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Clients discover operations through responses

**Example API Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "status": "active",
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/api/users/123" },
    "edit": { "href": "/api/users/123", "method": "PUT" },
    "delete": { "href": "/api/users/123", "method": "DELETE" },
    "orders": { "href": "/api/users/123/orders" },
    "deactivate": { "href": "/api/users/123/deactivate", "method": "POST" }
  }
}
```

**Business Considerations:**
- **Development Time**: Longer implementation time
- **Team Skills**: Requires specialized knowledge
- **Client Capability**: Not all clients can handle hypermedia
- **Maintenance Overhead**: More complex to maintain and debug

## Practical Implementation Strategies

### **Level 0 → Level 1 Migration**

**Step-by-Step Approach:**
1. **Identify Resources**: Map operations to logical resource groups
2. **Create Resource Endpoints**: Design URL structure for each resource
3. **Separate Operations**: Split complex operations into resource-specific endpoints
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep existing endpoints during transition

**Common Patterns:**
```
# Before (Level 0)
POST /api/service
{ "operation": "getUserById", "userId": 123 }

# After (Level 1)  
POST /api/users/getById
{ "userId": 123 }
```

### **Level 1 → Level 2 Migration**

**HTTP Method Mapping:**
1. **Audit Current Methods**: Identify all current operations
2. **Map to HTTP Verbs**: Assign appropriate HTTP methods
3. **Implement Status Codes**: Use proper HTTP status codes
4. **Update Client Code**: Modify clients to use correct methods

**Example Transformation:**
```
# Before (Level 1)
POST /api/users/getUser/123
POST /api/users/createUser
POST /api/users/updateUser/123
POST /api/users/deleteUser/123

# After (Level 2)
GET    /api/users/123      # 200 OK
POST   /api/users          # 201 Created
PUT    /api/users/123      # 200 OK
DELETE /api/users/123      # 204 No Content
```

### **Level 2 → Level 3 Migration**

**Hypermedia Introduction:**
1. **Start Small**: Add hypermedia to key workflows
2. **Choose Format**: Select hypermedia format (HAL, JSON-LD, etc.)
3. **Implement Links**: Add navigation and action links
4. **Update Clients**: Teach clients to follow links
5. **Gradual Expansion**: Extend hypermedia to more endpoints

**Implementation Considerations:**
- **Client Capability**: Ensure clients can handle hypermedia
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor payload size increase
- **Tooling Support**: Verify adequate tooling for chosen format
- **Team Training**: Invest in hypermedia knowledge and skills
