# HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2

## Overview

**HTTP/1.1** (1997) is the traditional web protocol that has powered the internet for decades. **HTTP/2** (2015) is a major revision that addresses HTTP/1.1's limitations with improved performance, efficiency, and capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing web infrastructure.

## Key Differences

| Feature | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Protocol Type** | Text-based | Binary |
| **Connections** | Multiple connections | Single connection |
| **Request Handling** | Sequential (blocking) | Multiplexed (parallel) |
| **Header Compression** | None | HPACK compression |
| **Server Push** | Not supported | Supported |
| **Stream Priority** | Not supported | Supported |
| **Flow Control** | TCP-level only | Stream-level control |
| **HTTPS Requirement** | Optional | Effectively required |

## HTTP/1.1 Characteristics

### **Connection Model**
- **Multiple Connections**: Browsers open 6-8 parallel connections per domain
- **Head-of-Line Blocking**: Requests must wait for previous responses
- **Connection Overhead**: Each connection requires separate TCP handshake
- **Keep-Alive**: Persistent connections to reduce handshake overhead

### **Request Processing**
- **Sequential Processing**: One request at a time per connection
- **Pipelining**: Optional but rarely used due to implementation issues
- **Resource Bundling**: Developers combine files to reduce requests
- **Domain Sharding**: Splitting resources across multiple domains

### **Performance Limitations**
- **Latency Sensitivity**: Each request-response cycle adds latency
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Redundant headers in every request
- **Connection Limits**: Browser limits total concurrent connections
- **Bandwidth Underutilization**: Connections often idle waiting for responses

## HTTP/2 Improvements

### **Binary Protocol**
- **Binary Framing**: More efficient parsing than text
- **Frame Types**: Different frames for headers, data, settings, etc.
- **Stream Identification**: Each request gets unique stream ID
- **Error Handling**: Better error detection and recovery

### **Multiplexing**
- **Single Connection**: All requests share one TCP connection
- **Parallel Requests**: Multiple requests processed simultaneously
- **No Blocking**: Slow requests don't block faster ones
- **Efficiency**: Better utilization of available bandwidth

### **Header Compression (HPACK)**
- **Compression Algorithm**: Specialized for HTTP headers
- **Static Table**: Common headers predefined
- **Dynamic Table**: Context-specific header compression
- **Bandwidth Savings**: 85-95% reduction in header overhead

### **Server Push**
- **Proactive Delivery**: Server sends resources before client requests
- **Cache Optimization**: Reduces round trips for critical resources
- **Push Promise**: Server notifies client of pushed resources
- **Client Control**: Clients can reject unwanted pushes

### **Stream Prioritization**
- **Dependency Tree**: Resources can depend on other resources
- **Weight-Based**: Relative importance between streams
- **Resource Optimization**: Critical resources prioritized
- **Client Hints**: Browsers can indicate priority preferences

## Performance Improvements

### **Real-World Performance Gains**

#### **Page Load Speed**
- **Typical Improvement**: 10-30% faster page loads
- **High-Latency Networks**: Up to 50% improvement on slow connections

### **Performance Scenarios**

#### **Best Case: Multiple Small Resources**
HTTP/2 excels when loading many small resources:
- CSS files, JavaScript modules, images, fonts
- API calls returning small JSON responses
- Real-time applications with frequent updates
- Single-page applications with many assets

#### **Marginal Case: Single Large Resources**
HTTP/2 benefits are minimal for:
- Large file downloads

**Image Sprites**
- HTTP/1.1: Combine images to reduce requests
- HTTP/2: Individual images allow better caching and loading

**Domain Sharding**
- HTTP/1.1: Spread resources across multiple domains
- HTTP/2: Single domain performs better with multiplexing

**Inlining**
- HTTP/1.1: Inline CSS/JS to avoid additional requests
- HTTP/2: External resources benefit from caching and push

### **New Optimization Opportunities**

#### **Server Push Strategies**
- **Critical CSS**: Push essential styles immediately
- **JavaScript Modules**: Push core application logic
- **Font Files**: Push custom fonts to avoid render blocking
- **API Prefetching**: Push likely-needed data

#### **Resource Prioritization**
- **Critical Path**: Prioritize resources blocking page render
- **Progressive Loading**: Structure loading sequence optimally
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer non-critical resources
- **Resource Hints**: Use preload, prefetch directives
