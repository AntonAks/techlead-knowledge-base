# Network Address Translation (NAT)

## Overview

**Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a method of mapping IP addresses from one address space to another by modifying network address information in IP packet headers while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

NAT was originally developed to address IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address for internet access.

## Core Concepts

### **Private vs Public IP Addresses**
- **Private IPs**: Used within local networks, not routable on internet
- **Public IPs**: Globally unique addresses routable on internet
- **NAT Device**: Router or firewall that performs address translation
- **Translation Table**: Mapping between private and public addresses

### **Address Spaces**
```
Private Address Ranges (RFC 1918):
10.0.0.0/8         (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255)
172.16.0.0/12      (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255)  
192.168.0.0/16     (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255)

Public Addresses:
All other IPv4 addresses (globally routable)
```

## Types of NAT

### **Static NAT (One-to-One)**
Maps one private IP address to one public IP address permanently.

```
Private Network          NAT Device          Internet
192.168.1.10  ←──────→  203.0.113.10  ←──────→  Internet Host
192.168.1.11  ←──────→  203.0.113.11  ←──────→  Internet Host
192.168.1.12  ←──────→  203.0.113.12  ←──────→  Internet Host
```

**Characteristics:**
- **One-to-One Mapping**: Each private IP maps to unique public IP
- **Permanent**: Mappings configured statically
- **Bidirectional**: External hosts can initiate connections
- **Predictable**: Always uses same public IP for each private IP

**Use Cases:**
- **Web Servers**: Hosting servers behind NAT
- **Mail Servers**: Email servers requiring consistent external IP
- **VPN Endpoints**: IPSec and other VPN termination points
- **Network Services**: DNS, FTP servers accessible from internet

### **Dynamic NAT (One-to-One Pool)**
Maps private IP addresses to public IP addresses from a pool on demand.

```
Private Network          NAT Pool              Internet
192.168.1.10  ←──────→  203.0.113.10-20  ←──────→  Internet
192.168.1.11  ←──────→  (Assigned on    ←──────→  Internet
192.168.1.12  ←──────→   demand)        ←──────→  Internet
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Pool of Addresses**: Multiple public IPs available
- **Dynamic Assignment**: IPs assigned as needed
- **Limited Connections**: Pool size limits concurrent users
- **First-Come-First-Serve**: IPs assigned to first requests

**Use Cases:**
- **ISP Customer Access**: Residential internet connections
- **Corporate Internet**: Multiple users sharing IP pool
- **Temporary Services**: Short-term internet access
- **Load Distribution**: Spreading traffic across multiple IPs

### **Port Address Translation (PAT/NAT Overload)**
Maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP using different ports.

```
Private Network          PAT Device            Internet
192.168.1.10:1234  ←──→  203.0.113.1:5001  ←──→  Internet Host
192.168.1.11:1234  ←──→  203.0.113.1:5002  ←──→  Internet Host  
192.168.1.12:4567  ←──→  203.0.113.1:5003  ←──→  Internet Host
```

**Translation Table Example:**
```
Inside Local    Inside Global     Outside Global    Outside Local
192.168.1.10:1234  203.0.113.1:5001  74.125.224.72:80  74.125.224.72:80
192.168.1.11:1234  203.0.113.1:5002  8.8.8.8:53       8.8.8.8:53
192.168.1.12:4567  203.0.113.1:5003  23.205.241.88:443 23.205.241.88:443
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Many-to-One**: Multiple private IPs share one public IP
- **Port Multiplexing**: Uses ports to distinguish connections
- **Stateful**: Tracks active connections
- **Unidirectional**: External hosts cannot initiate connections

**Use Cases:**
- **Home Routers**: Most common NAT implementation
- **Small Business**: Cost-effective internet sharing
- **Mobile Networks**: Carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT)
- **IPv4 Conservation**: Maximizing IPv4 address utilization

## NAT Operation

### **Outbound Traffic Flow**
1. **Internal Host**: Sends packet with private source IP
2. **NAT Device**: Receives packet, creates translation entry
3. **Address Translation**: Replaces private IP with public IP
4. **Port Translation**: Replaces private port with public port (PAT)
5. **Forward**: Sends modified packet to internet
6. **Table Update**: Records translation in NAT table

### **Inbound Traffic Flow**
1. **Internet Response**: Return packet arrives at NAT device
2. **Table Lookup**: NAT device checks translation table
3. **Address Translation**: Replaces public IP with private IP
4. **Port Translation**: Replaces public port with private port
5. **Forward**: Sends packet to internal host
6. **Table Maintenance**: Updates connection state

### **NAT Table Example**
```
Protocol | Inside Local    | Inside Global   | Outside Global  | Timeout

- **Fragmentation**: Packet fragmentation handling complexity

## NAT Traversal Techniques

### **UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)**
Automatic port forwarding for applications:
```
Application ─→ UPnP Client ─→ Router ─→ Port Forward Creation
```

**Process:**
1. Application requests port forwarding via UPnP
2. Router automatically creates NAT rule
3. External connectivity established
4. Rule removed when application exits

### **STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)**
Discovers NAT type and external IP address:
```
Client ─→ STUN Server ─→ Response with External IP/Port
```

**NAT Types Detected:**
- **Full Cone**: Same external port for all destinations
- **Restricted Cone**: External port restricted by destination IP
- **Port Restricted**: Restricted by destination IP and port
- **Symmetric**: Different external port for each destination

### **TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)**
Relay server for NAT traversal:
```
Client A ─→ TURN Server ←─ Client B
```

**Operation:**
1. Client establishes connection to TURN server
2. TURN server allocates external endpoint
3. Remote clients connect to allocated endpoint
4. TURN server relays traffic between clients

### **ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)**
Combines STUN and TURN for optimal connectivity:
```
1. Gather candidates (host, server reflexive, relay)
2. Exchange candidates between peers
3. Perform connectivity checks
4. Select best working path
```

## Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)
